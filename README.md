MARCELINO
=========

MARCELINO tries to be yet another simply window manager, using XCB as much as posible instead Xlib.
I've initially tried to develop it from scratch, however the documentation is ( that is only my opinion )
"limited" in detail and basically I got frustrated. So I've decided to fork a project that fits nicely 
what I was looking for, this project is MCWM ( See below Original project ).

NOTE: Don't even try to compile it, it does not work yet and it is a very much work in Progress.
